# Horse Show Scoring System (Task 1.6b+)

### Updated Scoring Formula with Health
The comprehensive scoring system for horse show competitions uses the following formula:

```
🏇 FinalScore =
  BaseStatScore (weighted: 50/30/20)
+ TraitBonus       (+5 if discipline matches horse trait)
+ TrainingScore    (0–100, optional)
+ SaddleBonus      (flat number)
+ BridleBonus      (flat number)
+ RiderBonus       (% of subtotal)
- RiderPenalty     (% of subtotal)
+ HealthModifier   (% adjustment based on rating)
```

### Scoring Components Breakdown
- **BaseStatScore**: Weighted combination of horse stats (50/30/20 distribution)
- **TraitBonus**: +5 points when horse's natural trait matches show discipline
- **TrainingScore**: 0-100 points based on horse's training level (optional component)
- **SaddleBonus**: Flat point bonus from equipped saddle
- **BridleBonus**: Flat point bonus from equipped bridle
- **RiderBonus**: Percentage increase of subtotal based on rider skill
- **RiderPenalty**: Percentage decrease of subtotal for rider mismatches
- **HealthModifier**: Percentage adjustment based on horse's health rating

### Health Modifier Reference Table
| Health Rating | Modifier |
|---------------|----------|
| Excellent     | +5%      |
| Very Good     | +3%      |
| Good          | 0%       |
| Fair          | -3%      |
| Bad           | -5%      |

### Integration with Eligibility System
- Eligibility (Task 1.6a): Determines which horses CAN enter shows
- Scoring (Task 1.6b+): Determines how well horses PERFORM in shows
- Health affects scoring but NOT eligibility (confirmed in 1.6a implementation)
- Trait matching provides scoring bonus but doesn't restrict entry

### Implementation Notes
- This formula will be implemented in future tasks (1.6b+)
- Current eligibility system (1.6a) is designed to work seamlessly with this scoring approach
- Trait-discipline matching provides competitive advantage without restricting participation

### `backend/utils/statMap.js` - Discipline Stat Mapping System
- **Purpose**: Defines stat weightings for all 21 competition disciplines
- **Structure**: Each discipline maps to [primary, secondary, tertiary] stats with 50/30/20% weights
- **Available Stats**: speed, stamina, agility, balance, precision, intelligence, boldness, flexibility, obedience, focus
- **Functions**:
  - `getStatsForDiscipline(discipline)` - Returns stat array for specific discipline
  - `getAllDisciplines()` - Returns all available discipline names
  - `getAllStatCategories()` - Returns all unique stat categories
  - `isDisciplineValid(discipline)` - Validates discipline existence
- **Usage**: Essential for BaseStatScore calculation in scoring system
- **Examples**: 
  - Racing: ["speed", "stamina", "focus"] 
  - Dressage: ["precision", "focus", "obedience"]
  - Show Jumping: ["balance", "agility", "boldness"]

### Horse Schema Updates - Complete Stat System
- **Migration Applied**: `20250525042054_add_missing_horse_stats` successfully added all required stat fields
- **New Stat Fields Added**: balance, boldness, flexibility, focus, obedience, stamina (all as optional Int fields)
- **Complete Stat Coverage**: All 10 stat categories from statMap now exist in Horse schema
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Kept existing strength and endurance fields for backward compatibility
- **Database Status**: All 151 tests passing, schema fully synchronized with competition requirements

- **Usage**: Core component of competition scoring system
- **Tests**: 5 test cases covering all scenarios and edge cases

### `backend/utils/healthBonus.js` - Health Modifier System
- **Purpose**: Converts health ratings to percentage modifiers for competition scoring
- **Function**: `getHealthModifier(healthRating)`

- **Return Format**: Decimal values (e.g., 0.05 for +5%, -0.03 for -3%)
- **Fallback**: Returns 0 for unknown health ratings
- **Usage**: Applied as final percentage adjustment to competition scores
- **Tests**: 2 test cases covering all health ratings and edge cases

### `backend/utils/riderBonus.js` - Rider Modifier System
- **Purpose**: Applies rider bonuses and penalties to competition scores
- **Function**: `applyRiderModifiers(score, bonusPercent, penaltyPercent)`
- **Formula**: `score * (1 + bonusPercent - penaltyPercent)`
- **Validation**: Bonus 0-10%, Penalty 0-8%, Score must be non-negative
- **Default Values**: Both modifiers default to 0 if not provided
- **Usage**: Applied before health modifier in scoring pipeline
- **Tests**: 5 test cases covering bonuses, penalties, combinations, and validation

### `backend/logic/simulateCompetition.js` - Main Competition Engine
- **Purpose**: Complete competition simulation with ranking and placement assignment
- **Function**: `simulateCompetition(horses, show)`
- **Scoring Formula Implementation**:
  1. Base stat score (weighted 50/30/20 from statMap)
  2. Trait bonus (+5 if horse.trait matches show.discipline)
  3. Training score (0-100, defaults to 0)
  4. Tack bonuses (saddle + bridle flat bonuses)
  5. Rider modifiers (percentage bonus/penalty)
  6. Health modifier (percentage adjustment)
- **Output**: Sorted array with horseId, name, score, placement ("1st"/"2nd"/"3rd"/null)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of calculation errors (assigns 0 score)
- **Placement Logic**: Top 3 horses get placements, others get null
- **Score Precision**: Rounded to 1 decimal place for display
- **Tests**: 8 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios

### Competition System Integration
- **Complete Scoring Pipeline**: All formula components implemented and tested
- **Modular Design**: Each component can be tested and used independently

- **Performance Ready**: Efficient calculation suitable for real-time competition simulation
- **Test Coverage**: 19 test cases covering all utilities and integration scenarios
- **Example Output**: 
  ```javascript
  [
    { horseId: 1, name: "Nova", score: 152.6, placement: "1st" },
    { horseId: 2, name: "Ashen", score: 147.3, placement: "2nd" },
    { horseId: 3, name: "Dart", score: 139.8, placement: "3rd" },
    { horseId: 4, name: "Milo", score: 122.1, placement: null },
    { horseId: 5, name: "Zuri", score: 118.9, placement: null }
  ]
  ```
